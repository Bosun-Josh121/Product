Once assigned a task, please follow these guidelines:&#x20;

***

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Getting Started

#### **Fork & Clone the Repository**

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
3.  **Set the upstream remote** to sync with the main repo:

    ```sh
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TrustlessWork/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
4.  Ensure you're on the latest version of `develop`:

    ```sh
    git checkout develop
    git pull upstream develop
    ```

***

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Branching Strategy

We follow a **structured branching model** to keep contributions organized.

#### **Main Branches**

* `main` â†’ The **production-ready** branch (DO NOT push here directly).
* `develop` â†’ The **active development** branch where features are merged.

#### **Feature & Fix Branches**

Create a branch based on the type of change:

* **Features:** `feat/feature-name`
  * Example: `feat/escrow-ui`
* **Bug Fixes:** `fix/bug-description`
  * Example: `fix/api-response-error`
* **Documentation:** `docs/update-name`
  * Example: `docs/getting-started-guide`
* **Refactoring:** `refactor/code-improvement`
  * Example: `refactor/clean-smart-contracts`

#### **Create a New Branch**

Always create a new branch before making changes:

```sh
   git checkout develop
   git pull upstream develop  # Sync with the latest code
   git checkout -b feat/new-feature
```

***

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Making Contributions

#### **Coding Standards**

âœ… Keep changes **small and atomic**.\
âœ… Follow **commit message guidelines** (see below).\
âœ… Ensure **tests pass** before submitting a PR.\
âœ… Format code using our **linting and formatting rules**.

#### **Commit Message Guidelines**

Use a **clear and concise** commit message format:

```
type: short description (less than 72 characters)
```

Examples:

* `feat: add escrow approval system`

* `docs: update README with setup instructions`

Types:

* `feat`: New feature
* `fix`: Bug fix
* `docs`: Documentation update
* `refactor`: Code restructuring
