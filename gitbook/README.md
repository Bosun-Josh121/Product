# Welcome

## Welcome to Trustless Work Documentation!

Trustless Work is an Escrow-as-a-Service platform designed to secure transactions with transparency, efficiency, and scalability. Whether you’re a developer looking to integrate blockchain-powered escrows, a platform aiming to build user trust, or an innovator seeking new financial solutions, you’re in the right place.

***

### **Why Trustless Work?**

*   **Escrows are a great way to solve for trust.**&#x20;

    Escrows are neutral way to hold funds while specific conditions are met. Think of it as a **secure, neutral envelope** where funds are kept until the conditions of a contract are met (or not)
* **Escrows with Fiat are next to impossible to do digitally (Legacy escrows).**\
  Escrows are more commonly found on high value transactions, like Real Estate, Merge and Aquisitions, and cross border trade mainly because they are costly. Fiat requires bank accounts or a complex settlement system to achieve this functionality, this makes them slow too. Big Techs like Upwork, or Ebay can afford this (their users pay high fees), but for most platforms it's too resource intensive or too expensive to integrate.&#x20;
* **Blockchain solves this, but complexity to do so is high.**\
  Blockchain and web3 are the perfect solution for this, but we can't expect for every marketplace out there to have a Smart Contract engineer. Getting to experiment, test and scale with this technology is resource intensive and has a high learning curve.

Trustless Work aims to solve trust in global payments by providing configurable, scalable, and transparent escrow infrastructure and tools for platforms to join the new economy.
