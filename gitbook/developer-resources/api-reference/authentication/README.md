# Authentication

### Introduction

An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests associated with your project. To use the API key effectively:

1. **Secure Storage:** Never expose your API key in publicly accessible areas of your code, such as version control or client-side code.
2. **Access Control:** Limit the permissions and scope of your API key to what is necessary for its intended use.
3. **Monitoring & Analytics:** Regularly monitor the usage of your API key and analyze access patterns to detect any unusual activities.
4. **Regeneration:** Periodically regenerate your API key to minimize security vulnerabilities due to prolonged exposure.

Ensure adherence to these practices to maintain the integrity and security of your API interactions.
